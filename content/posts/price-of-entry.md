# Price of Entry

During my coaching call this morning, Mike and I discussed the "price of entry"
into the upper echelons of thought leadership. What does it take to become an
influential person? Mike's answer: "being absolutely excellent at something."
This is easy to verifyâ€”just look at the guest list of any popular podcast.

As I would like to become one of these influential people, my immediate reaction
was to panic: "I'm not absolutely excellent at anything, so I guess I'll need to
become excellent at something. That'll take forever!" This, of course, is not
the right mindset.

I heard a story about a ceramics teacher that divided her class up into two
groups...[TODO: finish summary, include link].

The "price of entry" is not an achievement. There isn't a moment at which God
opens the heavens and proclaims, "Behold! Mastery has been achieved!" and hands
you a golden ticket that proclaims your worthiness as a human. The price of
entry is the **a process** of doing the work that brings you closer to mastery.
