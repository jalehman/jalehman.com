# Two Different Philosophies

Reading through [Guillermo Rauch's blog](rauchg.com) it became apparent to me
that he's a really smart dude with a lot of useful ideas. He's also working on a
transformation suite products for the internet via Vercel.

What he's doing at Vercel is also radically different than the approach taken by
Urbit (for instance, **All Code is Wrong** in his [2019 year in
review](https://rauchg.com/2020/2019-in-review))

My immediate reaction to the JAMstack and Vercel produces was that this is yet
another form of technological lock-in--it's encouraging "serverless", which
effectually seems like a way of saying "let other people worry about the
servers, dear." There's no way to really get around the need to have servers, so
the serverless movement shifts them onto other people's products. This
encourages less understanding and less ownership of data. By Urbit's standards,
this is software that is substantially less "real". (see Precepts)

There are also parallels here to Rich Hickey's philosophy as well. He's about
simplicity as opposed to ease--Vercel seems heavily on the "ease" side of things.
